            <p>Have you ever wondered why some people are so good at fulfilling their dreams and living a life of
                purpose?
                What is
                their "secret sauce" for success?

                Some people would say that all you need to do is work hard to achieve what you want in life. Some people
                think it's
                about who you know or what you have. Yet others feel there are those born with access and that they are
                given all the
                breaks in life. The truth is, statistics demonstrate that those who create goals and have a regular and
                consistent
                goal-setting process are much more likely to achieve their life’s dreams.</p>
            <p>“If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy and inspires your
                hopes.”<br> –
                Andrew Carnegie.</p>
