                <p>Have you ever wondered why some people are so good at fulfilling their dreams and living a life of
                    purpose?
                    What is
                    their "secret sauce" for success?

                    Some people would say that all you need to do is work hard to achieve what you want in life. Some
                    people
                    think it's
                    about who you know or what you have. Yet others feel there are those born with access and that they
                    are
                    given all the
                    breaks in life. The truth is, statistics demonstrate that those who create goals and have a regular
                    and
                    consistent
                    goal-setting process are much more likely to achieve their life’s dreams.</p>
                <p>“If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy and inspires
                    your
                    hopes.”<br> –
                    Andrew Carnegie.</p>

                <p>What is coding? Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers.
                    Code
                    tells a
                    computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning
                    to
                    write code, you
                    can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.</p>
