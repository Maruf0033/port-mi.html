        <p>Have you ever wondered why some people are so good at fulfilling their dreams and living a life of purpose?
            What is
            their "secret sauce" for success?

            Some people would say that all you need to do is work hard to achieve what you want in life. Some people
            think it's
            about who you know or what you have. Yet others feel there are those born with access and that they are
            given all the
            breaks in life. The truth is, statistics demonstrate that those who create goals and have a regular and
            consistent
            goal-setting process are much more likely to achieve their life’s dreams.</p>
        <p>“If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy and inspires your
            hopes.”<br> –
            Andrew Carnegie.</p>
